# <Horizion-Refactor>

## Description

I wanted to update and clean up both the html and css code, while keeping the  theme of the original webpage. I removed repeated code in css which removed the length of code by 30 lines while keepiong the site functional. I learned that I was over commenting on unecessary things and I ended up cleaning them up.
